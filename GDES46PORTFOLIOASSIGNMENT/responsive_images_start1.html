      <p><strong>Responsive web design</strong> (<strong>RWD</strong>) is an approach to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" title="Web design">web design</a> aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing and interaction  experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing,  panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop  computer monitors to mobile phones).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-fluid_grid-1">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-RWD_Exs-2">[2]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-ZMGflexEx-3">[3]</a></p>

      <h2>Media Queries</h2>
      <p><strong>Media Queries</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS3" title="CSS3">CSS3</a> module allowing content rendering to adapt to conditions such as screen  resolution (e.g. smartphone screen vs. computer screen). It became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_recommendation" title="W3C recommendation">W3C recommended</a> standard in <strong>June 2012</strong>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries#cite_note-DocHist-1">[1]</a> and is a cornerstone technology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" title="Responsive web design">Responsive web design</a>.      </p>
      <p><strong>Usage </strong></p>
      <p>A media query consists of a media type and one or more expressions, involving media features, which resolve to either true or false. The result of the query is true if the media type specified in the media query matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all expressions in the media query are true. When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules.[6][7] </p>
      <p><code>Here is a simple example: @media screen and (min-width:500px) { ... }</code><br>

      <h2>Mobile is Important</h2>
      <p>Responsive web design is becoming more important as the amount of mobile  traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-13">[13]</a> This trend is so prevalent that Google has begun to boost the ratings  of sites that are mobile friendly if the search was made from a mobile  device. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-14">[14]</a> This has the net effect of penalizing sites that are not mobile friendly.</p>

    <h2>Responsive background images</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If the background-size property is set to "contain", the  background  image will scale, and try to fit the content area. However, the image will keep its aspect ratio (the proportional relationship  between the image's width and height)</li>
      <li>If the background-size property is set to "100% 100%", the background image will stretch  	to cover the entire content area</li>
      <li>If the background-size property is set to "cover", the background image will scale  to cover the entire content area. Notice that the "cover" value keeps the aspect  ratio, and some part of the background image may be  clipped</li>

     <h2>Books and Resources</h2>
     <p>A good book on mobile design is <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/mobile-first" target="_blank"><em>Mobile First</em></a> by Luke Wroblewski. It talks about starting with a mibile design first instead of trying to squish a dektop design into a mibile form.      </p>
     <p>A good book on Responsive Design by the person who coined the term is <em><a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a></em> by Ethan Marcotte</p>
     <p>There are also many online resources, like <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCMQFjABahUKEwiu8MmAtrjIAhVOwIAKHTQnD70&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbradfrost.github.io%2Fthis-is-responsive%2F&usg=AFQjCNGgu9s51_wzCxeXJ9na0I7YvnlW5Q&sig2=xDQPrto3To_mkHrxJxbm_g" target="_blank"><em>This is Responsive</em></a> by Brad Frost.</p>
